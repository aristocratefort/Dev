            In this part we will talk about the number of grils friends of RALPH!

            Writer, historian, publisher, entrepreneur and driving force within the Napoleonic world for
            half a century, Jacques Jourquin died on November 14th. 
            His youthful looks (before his illness) belied his 86 years, and indeed given 
            his tireless activity he could easily have been mistaken for someone in his mid-sixties…. 
            It is difficult <span style="color: red;"> to summarise his career, so abundant and varied was it. To limit this obituary

            president of the publishing house Tallandier, he created the famous “Bibliothèque napoléonienne”; 
            there’s probably no Napoleonic library which doesn’t have several of the 120 or so volumes that were 
            published there. He re-launched the Revue de l’Institut Napoléon with Jean Tulard, was editor-in-chief 
            of the Revue du Souvenir Napoléonien from 1993 to 2005, directed Historia for two decades, participated 
            in the foundation of the magazine Napoléon Ier, etc. As a historian, he has written an irreplaceable Dictionnaire 
            des maréchaux du Premier Empire (1986), biographies of Ney (2004), Masséna (2007) and Morny (2011), a formidable study

            and no less than fifteen editions of memoirs. Since he owned part of Mamluk Ali’s papers, he undertook the publication of the 
            main unpublished pieces, including those on the Russian campaign and the return of the Napoleon’s mortal remains. Very recently, 
            he had just put the finishing touches to the great work of the second part of his life, namely, a study Napoleon’s library 
            on St Helena called La dernière passion de Napoléon, la bibliothèque de Sainte-Hélène, which he had the pleasure of seeing 
            published last September by Passés Composés. Below is a complete bibliography
